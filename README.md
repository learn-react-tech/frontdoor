# Front door

You are standing before a large, weather-worn door.

Thick vines cling to the stone archway, their tendrils frozen in time. The wood is ancient, darkened by rain and dust, etched with symbols you don’t recognize—yet somehow, they feel familiar. A brass knocker, shaped like a lion’s head, rests silently in the center. The wind rustles behind you, urging you forward.

The door is shut.
A chill creeps up your spine.
What do you do?
