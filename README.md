# Front door

You approach a strange gateway shimmering at the edge of the Web.

It stands tall—crafted from lines of code and bound by the laws of the virtual. The door is framed in components, each one nested perfectly within the other. At its center glows a strange rune: useEffect()—a call to action, or perhaps a warning.

The air crackles with static. Somewhere, far beneath your feet, a build process begins to run.

You feel the weight of uninitialized state.
A routing path lies undefined.
The interface awaits interaction.

To enter is to commit. To stay is to render nothing.

Will you open the Frontdoor?
